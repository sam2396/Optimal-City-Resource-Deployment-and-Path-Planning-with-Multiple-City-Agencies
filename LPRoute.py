## Name of the file: LPRoute.py
# The setup:
# install pands, numpy, pulp, networkx, matplotlib, haversine using 'pip install'.
# LPRoute.py generates paths for 'V' number of vehicles to be deployed given nodes
# which replicates locations that need to be covered by that vehicle in the form of a graph.
# This file uses synthetic graphs (which are in the form of Random Geometric Graphs RGG)
# as its input and prints the routes that can be taken by 'V' vehicles.
# In addition to the route paths for each vehicle this code also indicates whether or
# not there is an optimal solution given a synthetic graph and if there isn't one,
# it prints "infeasible solution".
# It also generates the enumerated nodes, total number of iterations, time taken in terms
# of CPU seconds and wall clock seconds.
# Once the required tools are installed, you can edit the number of vehicles to be deployed in this file
# by changing the value of 'V' or just run it on any python editor or using command line python LPRoute.py.
# Python version: Python 3.8.3
# To see these paths and outputs in more detail, see Routes with synthetic graph.ipynb
